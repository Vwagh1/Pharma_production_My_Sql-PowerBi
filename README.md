Pharma Manufacturing Data Analysis (MySQL + Power BI)

This project is based on a pharmaceutical manufacturing dataset that I generated and cleaned to practice real-world data analysis.
I worked on different steps like data cleaning, database design, SQL analysis, and building a Power BI dashboard for insights.

This is still an ongoing project, and I will keep adding more SQL queries and dashboards as I improve it.

Project Overview :-

The purpose of this project was to understand how a pharma production system works and how data can be used to check:
Batch quality,
Machine performance,
Employee contribution,
Defects and rejection trends,
Production cost and yield.

I used multiple tools for this:

MySQL → Data cleaning, constraints, joins, and analysis
Power BI → Dashboard and visual insights
Excel → Initial data files

What I Did in SQL:-

Cleaned the data,
Fixed null values,
Removed duplicates,
Standardized text,
Checked date formats,
Trimmed unnecessary spaces.

Added constraints:-

Primary keys,
Foreign keys,
Indexes for performance.


Performed analysis using joins, CTEs, and window functions
Some sample topics I covered:
Which batches failed and why,
Machine downtime vs yield,
Operator performance,
Defect patterns,
Cost analysis,
Monthly rejection trends,
High-risk batches.


Created reporting queries
These queries are used in the Power BI visuals.
All SQL queries are inside pharma_sql_project.sql.

Power BI Dashboard:-

I created a Power BI report that shows:
Overall production summary
Yield and cost insights
Defective products
Machine-wise performance
QC defect type distribution
Monthly trends
I have added the .pbix file in the Power BI folder.




Key Insights I Found:-

A few machines show higher downtime which affects batch yield.
Some operators consistently achieve better yield.
Certain defect types occur more often with specific products.
Temperature and pressure variations strongly influence batch rejection.
Cost per batch is higher when yield drops below a certain range.


Tools Used:-

MySQL Workbench

Power BI Desktop

Microsoft Excel




What I Plan to Add Next:-
More advanced SQL optimization
New dashboards for cost and machine analysis
Predictive insights based on defect patterns
Full ERD diagram



Thank You

This project helped me understand how a real pharma production and QC process can be analyzed using SQL and Power BI.
I will continue improving it as I learn more.

Feel free to check the SQL file and dashboard!


Project is not fully completed yet; I’m actively working on improving it.
